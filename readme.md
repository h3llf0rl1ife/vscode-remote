vscode extension features : 

- deploy a file directly using scp to server
- create a configuration file

planning :

- learn a little bit how vs extensions are developed we could use the examples shared before
- how to achieve our goal (scp, ssh ..)
- is there any vscode extension in github that has this functionality.
